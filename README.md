## 🧩 Projects

The certification also includes larger projects that combine multiple concepts into complete applications:

🔹 [01 – Build a Currency Converter](https://abdallahbenj.github.io/freecodecamp-front-end-development-libraries/01-currency-converter/)

🔹 [02 – Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://abdallahbenj.github.io/freecodecamp-front-end-development-libraries/02-tic-tac-toe/)

Each project reinforces real-world skills such as:

- Component composition
- State-driven UI
- Event handling
- Application structure

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

All exercises are deployed using **GitHub Pages** with:

- Vite `base` configuration
